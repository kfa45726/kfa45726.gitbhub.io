<h1> Hello! </h1> </div>
<p> My Name is Karla Abundis. I am nineteen years old and I'm from Kennesaw Georgia. 
I enjoy anything and everything that deals with fitness and sports! I grew up playing softball 
ever since I was nine years old. Once I was sixteen I began playing Lacrosse. Now I spend most of my time in the
gym performing many hard fitness tasks and lifting heavy weights

<h1> Work </h1>
<p> As you might have noticed, I am currently employed. I work at The Publix Shopping Center on
Atlanta Highway. I am a part time deli clerk there! So if you ever need any deli meats sliced, you know where to
go! I usually work Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays straight after school. I do everything from slicing hams
and boxing fried chicken
to making subs. I usually tend to work the closing shifts which requires alot of patience.
<p> George W. Jenkins, the late founder of Publix Super Markets Inc., was born Sept. 29, 1907. Growing up in Harris, GA, he worked in his father's general store. In 1925, he headed to Tampa, FL at the age of 17 with hopes
of making his fortune in the Florida real estate boom. Instead, he took a job as a stock clerk in a
Piggly Wiggly grocery store. After only a couple of months, he was promoted to manager and was later 
transferred to manage the chain's largest store in Winter Haven, a position he held from 1926 to 1930. It was that year that he resigned from Piggly Wiggly to start his own grocery store

 <H1> Training </h1>
<p> As you can also see, I spend majority of my time on the weekends training. Training at the gym that is. My training sessions consist of
 3 different types of workouts. They include: Upperbody, LowerBody, and Cardio. It is simple to achieve a healthy lifestyle, I believe it is all
 mind over matter. Below is a list of a few tips that helped me change my life for the better. </p>
 <ol>
 <li>Make fitness a habit</li>
 <li>Control your lifts</li>
 <li>Never give up</li>
 <li>Posture perfect</li>
 <li>Diet like you mean it!</li>
 <li>Drink water</li>
 <li>Learn from your mistakes</li>
 <li>Finish every rep </li>
 <li>Ask questions</li> </ol>
